        <p>Welcome to my virtual laboratory web-enabled application site.</p>
        
        <p><b>Summary of research interest:</b> My research interest lies in 
        the interdisciplinary area of biology, computer science, and statistics - 
        currently known as bioinformatics - looking at how can computer (information) 
        science and statistics help us unravel the mysteries of biology. On the 
        biological side, I am interested in genomics (DNA fingerprinting, gene pool 
        evolution and differentiation), transcriptomics (which genes are expressed 
        at what conditions and at what levels) and interactomics (how are these gene 
        products interacting in different conditions). On the computer science side 
        of the game, I am engrossed with effective management and use of biological 
        resource which includes published manuscripts. Quoting from a senior academic, 
        I believe that much of science has been deductionist (breaking down into 
        constituent components and studying a single component in extreme detail 
        which manifested in the "one-gene-one-thesis" approach) and maybe we have 
        enough components to re-build systems towards our initial goal of biological 
        science - what is life and how it works? In this aspect, will it be possible 
        to "re-design" or "re-build" a cell from the set of proteins that we have?</p>

       <!-- <li>
       <il>NotaLogger: Notarization Code Generator and Logging Service</il>
           <blockquote>
           A common challenge to examine notarized (signed and dated) records is the trust that the 
           date is accurate (not a backdate); hence, heavy responsibility will lie on the notarizer. 
           NotaLogger reduces this responsibility by generating a random code (known as a notarization 
           code), which can be appended to the notarization. The time and purpose for generating such 
           a notarization code will be logged in the database; thus, acting as a third-party counter-
           signing of a notarization.<br>
           You may proceed by either
